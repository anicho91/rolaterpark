            <!-- Rolater Park was created on October 23, 1931 by Dr. J. B. Rolater. 
            Dr. Rolater left rules and guidelines of how the park should be run and governed.
            Since 1931, the park has continued to be run and governed as stated in his will. -->

            <!-- Rolater Park contains both the Cave and Spring Cave Spring was named after.
            The cave is an amazing place to cool down during the hot Georgia summer 
            while the spring provides cold water that comes right out of the cave. From Memorial Day to Labor  -->
